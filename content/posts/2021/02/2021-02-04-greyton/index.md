We had temporary accommodation, staying in a back packers eco Lodge.  
Basically a bedroom, shared bathroom and kitchen but with beautiful mountain views.  

Janet, a loved local figure, was our very welcoming host. It was a bit worrying with the comings and goings of travelers, in view of virus, and we wanted to have our own place.

So after 2 weeks moved into the tiniest of cottages next to Greyton Nature Reserve and its mountains in Dan’s road until 16th.  
Then we will rent a lovely house in same road until we leave, hopefully extending our visas next week for 3 months. Our flight home has been cancelled.  
Who knows what next?
