<p>The main house is a tardis, the centre being the kitchen, where we all prepare our own food,from overflowing food stores  then maybe eat outside or where ever.</p>

<p>The family are&hellip;Joe and Wendy&hellip;Jennifer and Ross&hellip;.David (brother) and Alison (sister) Molly and Wilbur the dogs Saskia, George and Louis the cats Sheila, Chickpea, and Fenton the chickens who like a cuddle and are taller than the dogs</p>
<p>The first evening here Joe, Catherines dad ,did a  braii,( bbq,)and the wind  became so strong  all the red hot wood ashes had to be shovelled to an under cover bbq., After which we enjoyed delicious spare ribs and chicken</p>

<p>Sunday was Joe and Wendy&rsquo;s anniversary so we cooked a roast dinner complete with risen Yorkshire puddings followed by Berry pavlova made from 12 egg whites. Delicious</p>

<p>Decorating the tree meant a tradition of egg nog using 12 egg yolks and a vast quantity of rum, drunk with delivered pizzas, lots of fun and carols <a href="https://www.artamo.click/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/wpid-IMG_1278.jpg"><img src="images/wpid-IMG_1278.jpg" alt="image" title="IMG_1278.jpg"></a></p>
<p>Next Day we made a huge Christmas pudding for 21 folk on Christmas day. <a href="https://www.artamo.click/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/wpid-IMG_1298.jpg"><img src="images/wpid-IMG_1298.jpg" alt="image" title="IMG_1298.jpg"></a></p>
<p>Today is the the memorial service for Nelson Mandela and a history lesson for me -what an amazing person .. every one is celebrating his life. The singing so emotional and straight from the heart</p>

<p>Catherines grand parents invited us to dinner at their residential home complex last evening. A delicious meal, Angel fish, eaten with the residents . They have a beautiful home too. We are going to their holiday home at</p>
<p>Langebaan lagoon on Sunday and will celebrate Christmas there Friday  we will picnic at an outside Carol concert each one holding a little light</p>
<p>After lunch..so time for a swim&hellip; Then maybe to Hout Bay with Dan</p>
<p>RIP Madiba 1918 - 2013</p>
