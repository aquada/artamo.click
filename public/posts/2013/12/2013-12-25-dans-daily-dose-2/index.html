<p>I&rsquo;ve just been looking at some sketches I attempted yesterday afternoon. What a mess! Leaving the others to their afternoon snooze,  l took pencils and pad to the waters edge, found a sun and wind free spot,  then had to move because of close proximity to some dog poo (albeit dehydrated and free from pong! ), then chose my subject. &hellip;.. Some bobbing boats with a small building and vehicles in the back ground. A good start, then the wind turned the bobs into 180 degree turns, up, down, round and back, then the bobs got out of sync.with the turns. I now understand why Picasso  chose to paint in facets, perhaps he encountered a similar problem. Turned over the pad and me the other way. &hellip; Some fishermen silhouetted in the sun, meaning I did not have to bodge up their details. Planned it out, and then spent so long on the light and share of the boulders on which they stood, that I failed to notice in the meantime they had packed up and gone home. So, I ended up with Picasso cubes and Lowry match sticks. Maybe a fortune when l&rsquo;m gone.! <a href="https://www.artamo.click/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/wpid-IMG_54061.jpg"><img src="images/wpid-IMG_54061.jpg" alt="image" title="IMG_5406.jpg"></a></p>

<p>Now to the point of the heading. Realised it must be time for our daily dose of Dan&rsquo;s Dollop. (Brings back memories of a weekly dose of California syrup of figs, as a child, to keep us regular! ) This dose is quarter litre of freshly juiced organic vegetables . It comes in various shades according to content. &hellip;. sludge green, sludge red or sludge yellow. Sworn to give you energy , we are waiting to awaken with vital vitamin vitality and rejuvination Actually it&rsquo;s not bad if you down it in one like an after dinner tot. It will never replace the conventional aperitif, though. Thanks Dan, just joking. .. can&rsquo;t wait for the next surprise in half an hour! <a href="https://www.artamo.click/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/wpid-P10103621.jpg"><img src="images/wpid-P10103621.jpg" alt="image" title="P1010362.jpg"></a></p>
<p>Now the next morning</p>
<p>&hellip; stepped out of our room to a whirlwind of cerise confetti&hellip;.. did we have the bridal suite?&hellip;come off that cloud!!!!&hellip; the bougainvillea tree in the corner of the courtyard was losing its bloom to a somewhat frisky breeze. Each of the en suite bedrooms open on to this &lsquo;quadrangle&rsquo;with table and chairs. &hellip;.. It also has sliding glass doors to the lounge, dining area and kitchen, plus bedroom number 5 so comfortably housing 10 of us over Christmas? <a href="https://www.artamo.click/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/wpid-P10104051.jpg"><img src="images/wpid-P10104051.jpg" alt="image" title="P1010405.jpg"></a></p>

<p>Catherines aunt and family (11) are next door where we will all dine on Christmas Eve. Mike and I walked  our &lsquo;golden mile &lsquo;along the shore of the lagoon&hellip;.. climbing over boulders and then across flat stretches of sand. Seems like all the world and his boat was out. &hellip; All happy friendly people, mostly Afrikaners, having a good time on a Sunday morning, breakfasting in a beach bar where we had coffee. Catherines next door family went Cray fishing in their boat, but some engine trouble meant an empty net return.</p>
<p>A local Christmas craft fayre I meant Mike buying his Christmas outfit. &hellip; Just a little too big! !!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.artamo.click/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/wpid-20131221_1043481.jpg"><img src="images/wpid-20131221_1043481.jpg" alt="image" title="20131221_104348.jpg"></a></p>
<p>Now waiting for Catherines parents and sisters to arrive, the boys arrive tomorrow&hellip;&hellip;..</p>
<p>23rd December.   Catherines birthday&hellip;&hellip; presents and candles&hellip;.I made a candle tray from 3 strips of Sea weed, moulded and sun dried. &hellip;. These match the shell tree decorations. &hellip; so a nautical Christmas tide. Along the&rsquo;golden mile&rsquo; for coffee, then on to lunch a at a sea food restaurant on the beach. With the family.</p>
<p>Hope to add photos &amp; publish today <a href="https://www.artamo.click/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/wpid-IMG_53591.jpg"><img src="images/wpid-IMG_53591.jpg" alt="image" title="IMG_5359.jpg"></a></p>
