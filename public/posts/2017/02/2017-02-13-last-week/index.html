<p>No real excitement since I last put finger to keyboard. Thank you for your good wishes if you remembered my birthday, and if you didn&rsquo;t, thanks for not thinking of me getting older!!   The morning started with a 7 am walk into the mountains. Thought we&rsquo;d avoid the heat of the day and find the swimming dam.

<p>After weeks of drought conditions, a month&rsquo;s  rainfall fell in 2 days. It had to be one of those 2 days we chose to take a trip to Hermanus, the nearest big town and on the coast. The elements didn&rsquo;t prevent us enjoying the day, however, visiting some exceptional small art galleries, craft shops, before lunching in a polythene windowed , windswept cafe on the beach. The food so fresh and delicious, made up for a murky sea view</p>
<p>. The last couple of weeks have flown by, working with  seemingly slow progress. Catherine is now ready to launch her practice&hellip;&hellip;tinctures bottled and labelled, publicity ready to circulate and a temporary sign will hang from a rustic gallows, which Mike has made, by the front gate.</p>
<p>I have painted my two cranes  on  the bathroom door&hellip;.. was going to be a stylized picture of loo and shower, but thought we&rsquo;d leave room to guess what&rsquo;s within!</p>
<p>​​</p>

It was fantastic..​</p>
<p>​ ​ Last evening we were entertained by local musicians in  Greyton Lodge&rsquo;s  garden, flanked by the mountains in the setting sun, it was a truly memorable event</p>
<p>​ . These two outings herald our  sojourn of a few days in Langabaan, Catherine&rsquo;s grandparents  holiday home by a beautiful  lagoon and harbour on the south west coast.</p>
<p>Next blog from there, </p>
<p>Bye for now xx</p>
