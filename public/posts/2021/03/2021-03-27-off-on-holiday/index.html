A previous rainy day, hampered by a power cut, meant that washing not yet spun had to be collected early on the morning of our departure after being dried at the local laundry.

<p>8am Friday 19th March…</p>
<p>A previous rainy day, hampered by a power cut, meant that washing not yet spun had to be collected early on the morning of our departure after being dried at the local laundry.</p>
<p>Loaded to the gunnels we set off for a 3 week holiday. The first 2 weeks being spent just outside Plettenberg, and the 3rd at the holiday farm in the Karoo ,created by Wendy and Joe.</p>
<p>En route, an old converted prison ‘The Old Jail House’ at Riversdale provided us with lunch. A very interesting place, the cells housing antiques and artifacts to browse whilst awaiting our food.</p>
<p><img src="images/d11ba34e3d2a876d119571e28dc12e912045554f.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>A bit of a let down food wise though … perhaps they went a step too far in authenticity with a jailbird menu! Not on our repeat visit list!</p>

<p>The sun rayed down on us as we continued along our route</p>
<p>stopping briefly for a cuppa.</p>
<p>We broke the first journey with an overnight stay at &lsquo;The Old Trading Post, ’ glamping’ (luxury camping).</p>
<p>Two tents, a small outside kitchen, loo, and shower. No doors so open to the elements which turned rather chilly that night.</p>

<p>Eleanor transfixed by the fire</p>
<p>Dinner was cooked on a braii… A fire built from wood which has to be left until it is cinders for cooking. So this waiting time had to be filled with aperitifs… What a shame! Our chicken, sausages and squash were cooked to perfection and we loaded more wood then sat round the embers to keep warm.</p>

<p>The next morning 3 of us showered outside, but I chickened out and washed with Eleanor’s baby wipes. A walk for Tilia, then off to Plettenberg.</p>
<p>A luxury abode, that can spaciously accommodate a dozen people…mod. cons. including en suites and a dish washer! The annexe also boasts a large table tennis table with seating for onlookers.</p>
<p><img src="images/458ef73042a716e5c75717ffd34df1223e9356f2.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>A walk across the complex road and there… the beauty of the River Keurbooms and its surroundings greeted us… A bit chilly but we braved it for a short reedy swim.</p>
<p><img src="images/b8b49e57366be768a2b93d94827da298d29b5ee6.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Catherine’s mum Wendy, her parents Bill and Peggy, and a friend Sally, arrived in time for supper.</p>
<p>After the camp beds of previous night we slept well in a lovely comfy bed.</p>
<p>Saturday was market day where we enjoyed a second breakfast of bacon rolls. All the markets we have visited never fail to surprise us with something new, be it food or unusual crafts.</p>
<p>Sunday we were hosts for friends of Bill and Peggy, making a delicious cold buffet. In their late eighties and nineties they thoroughly enjoyed reminiscing.</p>
<p><img src="images/57934a5a8e9cfc46398b279c5c6b2912a6e36e78.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Such memories too! Bill, at 90, especially has a fantastic memory and is a fount of information. Sadly his failing eyesight necessitates wearing a miner’s type light which can be blinding talking face to face.!</p>
<p>The outlaws left the following day to return to Cape Town, a nine hour trip. I take my hat off to Wendy, who organises everything, is the driver, and proud to be so in their old faithful Land Rover, &lsquo;Roger’ who’s experienced a history of African adventures.</p>
<p>More to follow in next blog….</p>
