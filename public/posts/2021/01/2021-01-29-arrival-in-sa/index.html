We arrrived at Cape Town 1pm..Went for reserved hire car.. Another cockup.. No car!  ….
Managed after 2 hours to find another car.. Still lugging our cases
Drove to Langebaan.. Catherine’s granddad’s holiday home.. By a beautiful lagoon on the Western coast. 

Stayed there in isolation and recuperated on our own for a week.  Such a fantastic place reviving memories too. Just what we needed. So many thanks to Bill, and Wendy who prepared it for us.">
