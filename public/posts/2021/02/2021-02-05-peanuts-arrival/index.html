A family of guinea-fowl, chose the wrong moment to cross the road, one of which went under the car but just escaped the wheels.</p>

<p>Baby Peanut was born by Caesarean section at 11.45am.<br>
A lusty healthy 3.67k (just over 8 lbs) daughter. Dan assisted in the birth by cutting her 9 month lifeline, welcoming her, yelling and kicking, into her new world.</p>

<p>Joe, now able to travel, met Wendy in Hermanus and brought her back to Greyton. Us first time grandparents had a celebratory champagne supper in Columba, Dan and Catherine’s cottage.     Very happy outlaws!</p>

<p>Dan was able to stay two nights at the clinic,  joining<br>
us Monday evening at a spacious apartment we were fortunate enough to use, close to clinic, (thanks to a  covid cancellation,) belonging to Catherine’s cousin.</p>

<p>We were introduced to Peanut, Tuesday lunchtime when she arrived with her mum and dad for lunch. Eleanor Claire Phillips was named with a champagne toast, and a lusty serenade from herself.</p>

<p>This spacious accommodation afforded the new family to have an annexe whilst we were in the main house. Next to a lagoon, in a  beautiful holiday village. What more could we want.?<br>
We all mucked in enjoying each others’ company and sharing tasks including us grans doing hand washing in the bath!</p>
