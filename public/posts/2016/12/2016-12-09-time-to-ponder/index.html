<p>One of my favourite poems and now the time to fulfil it&rsquo;s words. Quietly watching, seeing things so easily missed.</p>
<p>A beautiful bird, just a bit bigger than a sparrow, sporting a long tail of brightly coloured plumage, foraging for insects in the earth around my feet. A mouse bird&hellip;.a name most unworthy of its  miniscule splendour.</p>
<p>A field mouse, scuttling by, also looking for its breakfast.</p>
<p> An undetected movement in the undergrowth, the bulbous eyes of frog or toad revealing its identity. l need to have my camera always at hand.</p>
<p>A plague of locusts???  This was Catherine&rsquo;s discovery!  Not really a plague just my sparse biblical knowledge and over active imagination kicking in. This time luckily a camera was at hand to record a happy gathering of these brightly coloured insects, having never seen a locust before. Apparently, harmless, but not a risk I&rsquo;d take.</p>

<p>So much more to watch and wonder.</p>

<p>Rain today so inside jobs and pleasures</p>
<p>Then the Hadadas who ha de da at the most inappropriate times. Haven&rsquo;t learnt that morning doesn&rsquo;t start at 4am! I stalked a couple this time with a camera&hellip;. They knew I was coming, walking duck style into the trees for camouflage but when in the sunlight , beautiful hues reflected from them. No photo though.</p>
