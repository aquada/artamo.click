A very lively atmosphere prevails among vendors of home baked goodies, home grown veggies, crafts of many different skills, and their customers. A horse drawn cart is the local taxi, children enjoy pony rides.

<p>The 10th December was a very special market day. Catherine set up her own stall selling her home produce. Healthy breakfasts of home made yogurt and granola, advertised on a blackboard enticed folk to try. This was served in small dishes with a spoon.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.artamo.click/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/wp-1481476624179.jpg"><img src="images/wp-1481476624179.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Alongside breakfast, Catherine&rsquo;s cordials were beautifully displayed, made from hand picked blueberries and elderflower. The latter growing amongst brambles in marshy land, so she set off before the sun was too hot, 9 in long wellies, on her bicycle.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.artamo.click/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/wp-1481473540241-1.jpg"><img src="images/wp-1481473540241-1.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Much time and thought was put into the cordial making and label designs. Small packets of herbal tea, were arranged in a basket, and to complete her table Catherine had painstakingly made beautiful herb bags, from muslin and lace tied with a ribbon.</p>

<p>Catherine and Daniel set off early and  we  followed a bit later. Big smiles greeted us&hellip; Customers already sampling and happy with their buys. So worth all the preparation and a confident start to the enterprise. Another well done both.</p>
<p>Lunch that day was  delicious home made duck and cherry pies . So many enterprising people. Think these will be our Saturday special.</p>
