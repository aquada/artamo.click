<p>Just outside the back of the cottage, is a lae water, a forever flowing stream, that gives all homes access to water, to fill their dams, each proprietor, having contributed, given a time slot for the refill. Wonderful for dipping hot smelly toes into &hellip; Cool and fast straight from the mountain.<a href="https://www.artamo.click/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/wp-1480936498267.jpg"><img src="images/wp-1480936498267-e1481124551317.jpg" alt="Lae Water"></a></p>
<p>Daniel and Catherine are converting their dam into a natural swimming pool with specially chosen vegetation as a filter system.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.artamo.click/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/wp-1480937313323.jpg"><img src="images/wp-1480937313323-e1481124577525.jpg" alt=""></a>The cheerful local laborers are hard working and willing to please, always with lunch thrown  in.</p>
<p>Whilst sitting with Catherine by the lae water idly chatting , her sharp eye detected a quick movement in the bushes. The first guess was that it was some sort of small rodent scavenging. She then spied the bulgy eyes of a small frog or toad. Closer, very quiet observation, showed the reason for the bulge. It&rsquo;s little squirming body was being squashed to pulp to aid digestion by a mole snake. Harmless to us, but that&rsquo;s not much use to the victim. Too dark in there to get a good photo, but just as well&hellip;. Not a pretty sight!!</p>
<p>Off to an open air children&rsquo;s carol service, when a wet patch was seen by the back door. Each of us saw it and decided it had been thrown to water nearby tree. On our return 2 hours later the patch had spread and still growing. A  leak somewhere underground. So water off, quick licks and a dabble in the lae water sufficed for ablutions, that night.A dig next morning revealed the cause, which gave Mike the excuse to get stuck into something. Pipes replaced, water diverted , showers taken, so pongs gone in next to no time!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.artamo.click/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/wp-1480946378441.jpg"><img src="images/wp-1480946378441-e1481124650884.jpg" alt=""></a>Then discovery time. A &lsquo;reason for being there&rsquo; slab was upended, and a mini excavation resulted in a pool of under ground water and the remains of a water pipe with a tap. Catherine was in her element, grovelling in the mud, even with her best dress on!! This means another water supply, free of charge, to the dam&hellip;&hellip;&lsquo;Mum&rsquo;s the word!&rsquo;,</p>
