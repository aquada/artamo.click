<p>Life is very busy here. A lot to be achieved for Dan and Catherine to realize their dream. Two small rent-able straw bale units to be built, Catherine&rsquo;s practice to be launched, both giving the income to afford a larger straw bale home for themselves.  A car port is the first necessity to house the straw which is now on the site of the potential units. Being very difficult to get materials locally, meant a trip to Cape Town. Mike and I went alone as Catherine and Dan were busy. Also gave them a chance to reclaim their new, very comfortable bed, if only for a few days.</p>

      <p>Celebrating Catherine&rsquo;s birthday meant lunch out. Dan organized a surprise picnic for us all in the mountains, but due to inclement weather&hellip;. high winds and promised rain, chose a restaurant close by. It was like a French cafe , but with smiling, coloured staff. A lovely meal,three of us had yellow tail fish and Catherine had a lamb curry. We returned via the back roads mostly unmade and winding through townships. Some of these have become quite upmarket, having wooden or bamboo structures. It amazes me how many people fit into such a small home. They all seem so happy. Most have no transport, and walk for miles or hope for a lift. Catherine stayed in two of these &lsquo;huts&rsquo; whilst on a course so was our travel guide for the afternoon. There are mostly indigenous folk here who speak Africaans, but their smiles know no barriers.</p>

      <p>Catherine and Daniel decided they would like to spend their first Christmas in Greyton in their cottage, Columba.  Hardly  room for all the family, so we felt privileged to spend it with them,   just the 4 of us. We decorated a fir branch with treasured hangings and some simple lights. A small wooden nativity scene which I bought at the local craft market completed the scene. It is so pretty at virtually no expense<img src="images/dsc_0389-e1482420679189.jpg" alt=""> <img src="images/P1040686.jpg" alt=""></p>

      <p>Dan and Catherine were invited to see some straw bale houses, built by their owners. These very delightful people had attended courses and done much research before starting.</p>
<p>So mum and dad go along too, to be a nuisance and add opinions.</p>
<p>It seemed like we were driving forever along a long and dusty track the other side of &rsquo;their&rsquo; mountains. The experience was well worth the dust enshrouded car. Certainly lost its newly polished look now!</p>

      <p>And stare as long as sheep or cows. No time to see, when woods we pass, Where squirrels hide their nuts in grass. No time to see, in broad daylight, Streams full of stars, like skies at night. No time to turn at Beauty&rsquo;s glance, And watch her feet, how they can dance. No time to wait till her mouth can Enrich that smile her eyes began. A poor life this is if, full of care, We have no time to stand and stare. <em>William Henry Davies</em></p>

      <p>Day 3. Arrived at Greyton after a beautiful drive along South coast, then inland to &rsquo;their&rsquo; mountains. Very reminiscent of Julian&rsquo;s home environment.. Both have chosen mountain surroundings and dirt track roads (currently a quagmire in Spain). Must be nostalgia from their birth home, also on a dusty bumpy road</p>
<p>Woweeee!!!  The cottage is incredible! They have worked so hard, acquiring by hit and miss , and sheer determination many new skills. Our hats off to them both&hellip;Catherine, mostly used to academia, and Dan after 6 years of virtual immobility&hellip;Well done both!</p>
