<p>A champagne lunch on the beautiful Hermanus coast celebrated Dan and Catherine’s 12th anniversary… Really that long?… and a satisfactory check at the natal clinic. Eleanor now graces us with endearing smiles and, do I hear?…. a silent chuckle too! ….definitely a ‘coo’! Not ready for a sea paddle yet!</p>

<p>Then a disappointment… There are buyers for our rental house, which means we have to find alternative accommodation yet again, just as we were feeling settled too. Another house a stone’s throw away suited our needs but unfortunately was a steep climb to the entrance. Apart from the wear and tear on our leg muscles, which we try to avoid at all costs, it would be difficult for Dan, even on his electric bike, and Catherine with pram to ascend.</p>

<p>Having been moved in 3 days we’d decided to invite the Outlaws for my birthday braii. A surprise for Dan and Catherine. Her mum, Wendy, and her parents, Bill and Peggy, came bearing gifts of a much missed beverage to accompany lunch. This commodity was gladly welcomed with hanging out tongues, sales of alcohol having been suspended for the last few weeks.</p>

<p>A lovely day and we had a delicious meal, lots of chatting and reliving of our previous times together. We are so happy to be welcomed as part of this all embracing family. All besotted with our new grand and great granddaughter. So many cuddles.. Eleanor must have wondered what this new world was like! We passed a lovely afternoon and were so pleased that they had made the long trip to be with us.</p>

We are now really loving this next rental… 5 moves in as many weeks!</p>
<p>A beautiful cottage house in the same street. .. We’re no.43…..Dan’s no. 57…so just a short walk. Fantastic mountain views with our own Vesusius, especially when the clouds ‘erupt’ on a misty morning.
<img src="images/c75ca83aa82b1e8acf270924e8f83a066854a31c.jpg" alt="">
It has 3 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms(1 en suite ). Large lounge and fitted kitchen. Garage and ample parking space.

<img src="images/c9fc05fe0efa73b22fb9724716dfaa1674d180a5.jpg" alt="">
Very spacious with an absolutely delightful garden.. Full of all the old English flowers and shrubs… Golden Rod, Buddleia, Wysteria plus indigenous Agapanthus and Bourgainvillea.
<img src="images/208753c09fe903cf5038d20758e4ab8816d9c00a.jpg" alt="">
All this is maintained by a local worker. It is an organised wilderness with lei water (water channeled from the mountains, that residents can subscribe to use in turn to fill their pools (dams)) running through it. There are 3 little bridges crossing it with bird tables and feeders around. A herb garden with a lemon tree in its midst completes the picture.
<img src="images/41a14a6bcb2fb5e3d518ea02b3f1b66f68dc3c10.jpg" alt="">
We now have it for 5 months assuming our visa applications are approved. It is an absolute paradise. We would love to buy..so may get hold of owner asking if he can stall selling until we are ready.</p>

<p>Mike’s back has now taken its toll of all the heavy lugging and lifting of cases. Home exercises rather than improving the situation only exasperated the condition. A local osteopath confirmed that he had damaged a muscle causing the pain which extended to the shoulder. Light exercise and much rest were prescribed. Unfortunately, the patient, doesn’t understand these two requirements, so recovery will take a long time. So now a ’grumpy ole man’</p>

      <p>An appointment in Cape Town  to tender our applications for a 3 month extension visa enabled Joe to return home with us to resume his work… Not all of us on holiday..!</p>
<p>Cape Town is the second most populated city in South Africa after Johannesburg. It is colloquially called ‘the Mother City’.It houses the South African Parliament and is the administrative centre for all localities.</p>

<p>Saturday 2nd January, 6 am, saw Wendy negotiating the hour’s emergency drive to Hermanus Clinic with Catherine and Dan in the back trying to control her labour pains. A family of guinea-fowl, chose the wrong moment to cross the road, one of which went under the car but just escaped the wheels.</p>

Basically a bedroom, shared bathroom and kitchen but with beautiful mountain views.</p>
<p>Janet, a loved local figure, was our very welcoming host. It was a bit worrying with the comings and goings of travelers, in view of virus, and we wanted to have our own place.</p>

<p>So after 2 weeks moved into the tiniest of cottages next to Greyton Nature Reserve and its mountains in Dan’s road until 16th.<br>
Then we will rent a lovely house in same road until we leave, hopefully extending our visas next week for 3 months. Our flight home has been cancelled.<br>
Who knows what next?</p>

We  had to travel 2 hours each way to a private clinic in Almeria twice… Not very pleasant as among possible sufferers.
