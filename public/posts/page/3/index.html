<p>It&rsquo;s two weeks since our return from Port Alfred. During this time we have enjoyed an Indonesian supper cooked by Henriette next door and a braai with Mandy and Brian. Henriette prepared a salad accompanied by a very moreish hot peanut sauce and toasted coconut. The evening was spent listening to illustrated stories of her and Joop&rsquo;s amazing life. In contrast, we were then invited to Mandy and Brian&rsquo;s for a South African stew cooked in a cauldron over a braai. From the trees hung lanterns creating eerie shapes and shadows so with the cauldron and their three large dogs wandering about completed this awesome atmosphere. We were eight and we jelled in such good company with lots of chatter and a laugh or two!!!</p>

<p>A rainy start, after all the beautiful weather of recent weeks. Loaded to the gunnels we set off for our holiday in a clean, newly valeted car. We took the gravel back roads before joining the major route. Mistake! Moving aside to allow a large farm vehicle to pass, it rewarded us by revving through a deep puddle, consequently giving us a mud bath; windows and glass roof were smothered. An hour later the sun baked it to a hard crust&hellip;.. X-Trail pie!! On arrival at a planned rustic restaurant to meet friends, we found they had no electricity, so a very limited menu. Is this a bad omen? However, the lunch they managed to conjure up was delicious, and the friends very interesting company too. So many towns, all with their own rustic or historical charm. With no further incidence, three hours later, we installed ourselves in a small tent and a &lsquo;Rondavel’ in ‘Ebb and Flow’ campsite next to a meandering river, amidst a National Park, where we were to stay for 3 days.</p>

<p><strong>Thank you</strong> for reading and sending your comments and emails. I love the contact and it makes writing the blog worthwhile. So sorry for this delay. We have been living with Mother Nature who does not facilitate technology!</p>
<p>These delightful children are from a small kindergarten just across the road from us. Out for a morning walk, with their cheerful carer, they were only too happy to oblige with this sunny photo, climbing over each other to make sure they were in the front! The last time I met them was on a walk in a very scarce fall of rain, all singing &ldquo;It&rsquo;s raining, it&rsquo;s pouring, the old man&rsquo;s snoring&rdquo; of course I just had to join in, much to their amusement!!!</p>

<p>Monday 11th found us on our way to Constantia, accepting Wendy and Joe&rsquo;s open invitation to stay any time, leaving Dan and Catherine to their own devices. So some fun time for the &lsquo;outlaws&rsquo;!! We arrived mid-afternoon, to a much cooler temperature. A hot cup of tea welcomed us. After a lovely fish supper with the family, the evening of nattering soon passed. A chilly night, we needed our long pants and sweaters.</p>

<p>Walking around Greyton most days, we are now seeing and absorbing the true essence of the town. &lsquo;Our&rsquo; cottage, &lsquo;Columba&rsquo;, is about 3/4 along Park Straat (Park Street) which runs the length of the town leading to a hikers&rsquo;paradise, Greyton Nature Reserve. The reserve lies on the steep southern slopes of the Riviersonderend (get your tongue around  that!) Mountains forming part of the Cape Folded Belt. It homes much wildlife including baboons which may occasionally wander into gardens in hope of some tasty morsel, so secure dustbin lids! Within, a choice of walks is displayed from which you can choose according to your ability, energy or challengability (a mo-ism). One of its several mountain pools serve as a swimming hole, to where locals walk from some distance to plunge into the mountain freshness.</p>

Not much has changed, except perhaps the market place, as mentioned in my last blog, and meeting some new acquaintances of Dan and Catherine. It&rsquo;s about a 1/2km walk to the market. People come from as far as Cape Town to shop here on a Saturday morning. All happy, smiley folk, so friendly and ready for a chat. The main street is crisscrossed with shoppers, horses clopping along, wagging tailed dogs waiting for a titbit, all of these being avoided by the traffic meandering through town.</p>

      <p>Greyton is a small village in the Western Cape, tucked against the mountains of Overberg. A town where everything is within walking distance using tree lined, dirt or tarred roads.</p>
<p><img src="images/p1040645-86290159.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The pace is slow, people friendly with horses free to roam, except on Saturday mornings when they give rides from the market, a horse and&rsquo; chariot&rsquo; act as a taxi. The heart of the village boasts restaurants, coffee cafes,charity shops , boutiques (bring and buy good quality clothes), and unusual gift shops. Thanks to the strict building code, the Cape vernacular architectural style has largely been preserved.</p>

Catherine spent  much of her happy childhood here, canoeing on the beautiful lagoon, collecting winkles and mussels among the rocks, netting for langoustines , prawns and other crustaceans from a fishing boat, with her siblings. Her grandparents bought the property, a five bedroomed holiday home many years ago, to accommodate the whole family on fun filled vacations. It has, and still is,  fulfilling its purpose . As the family has grown, Jenny, an aunt, has bought an adjacent property, so cousins with their partners, all water sport lovers can spend time here. The town has grown , housing a yacht club, some shops, restaurants, and a sailing centre.​​​</p>

      <p>  Back again with an update.</p>
<p>No real excitement since I last put finger to keyboard. Thank you for your good wishes if you remembered my birthday, and if you didn&rsquo;t, thanks for not thinking of me getting older!!   The morning started with a 7 am walk into the mountains. Thought we&rsquo;d avoid the heat of the day and find the swimming dam. Didn&rsquo;t quite reach our destination as the path was getting too rough and stumbly, not wearing appropriate foot wear&hellip;. flip flops a bit precarious. Another excuse&hellip; a really minor one of course&hellip; was that we could hear the baboons in close proximity, and didn&rsquo;t have Catherine&rsquo;s bush skills to protect us ! Mike caught me daring them to come any nearer..</p>
