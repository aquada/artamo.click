      <description>&lt;p&gt;We finally made it.. Absolutely exhausted mentally and physically!  Can’t remember what I’ve told you as lost my e mails.. Too many countries, WiFi s and changes of phone etc.  A brief resume…. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All started trying to get our covid jabs. Only us would have a flight after a bank holiday in Spain. This meant no local clinics open. We  had to travel 2 hours each way to a private clinic in Almeria twice… Not very pleasant as among possible sufferers. By some sleight of hand managed to get results in the mandatory 35 hours before flight. &lt;/p&gt;</description>
