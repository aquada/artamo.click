      <p>Another nail biting long wait in the immigration office in Cape Town. We collected our visa extension results..Yippee! Not too painful either. We lunched on the way home at a favourite half way restaurant. The Yippee turned to horror, after checking our visas. Oh no!&hellip; a mistake with the expiry date&hellip;&hellip;and not in our favour, having cut our return date by two months! Why, oh why did we not check this at desk?.. So much confusion at the time, we just grabbed and ran.</p>

      <p>Once again we have defeated the Covid pandemic. We, the intrepid duo, will not be beaten. We did it before, we&rsquo;ll do it again! This time, a year later, with two  cancelled flights on airlines refusing to fly to South Africa, we sought a third, Swiss Airways. Every day until we left we dreaded that this one may follow suit, especially as the new variant Omicron raised its ugly head. Lady Luck was on our side, however, and with blood streams surging with anti viral drugs, noses and throats swabbed, and an abundance  of necessary documentation we  travelled, albeit with some trepidation. Circumstances can change so rapidly in such a precarious crisis . The journey was longer this time as involved a seven hour stop over in Zurich, but much less stressful,  and went to plan. Were we relieved to clear customs at Cape Town air port after a thirty hour trip.?</p>

      <p>Our covid vaccinations have been awaiting our return from SA. All very well organised and efficientally executed. This totally negated our belief in the Spanish &rsquo;laissez-faire&rsquo; attitude. In this instance anyway. We were soon to learn that it indeed does still exist&hellip;. And mañana is never the next day! We thought that France slowed us down, but we&rsquo;re now so slow we&rsquo;ll soon be going backwards..!</p>
<p>Our first resident guests were Esha and Luna&hellip; Our grand dogs. With Julian in Madrid, and Lorena and Manolo having to go to Valencia, (5 hours away) to get the necessary paperwork to allow Manolo to visit his father and family in Columbia, gave us the pleasure of dog caring. Not ideal in a first floor apartment but plenty of space outside for walking and romping&hellip;&hellip;.us the former, hounds the latter! The front balcony was shady for them to sleep and in the heat , loved to spread themselves across tiled floors, usually in a door way. Morning walking was along a lane to the mountains and open scrub-land. In the evening they reveled in the beach night time walks and swims&hellip;always a roll in the sand and a good shake after&hellip; always with a poo bag!&hellip; so obedient, a joy to have them.</p>

<p>The weather here is very erratic, with so much rain this autumn/winter. From hot sunny days to below 9°at night. So now looking forward to Spain’s welcoming all round warmth.</p>
<p>We’ve had a few braais which is our favourite way of eating.</p>

<p>Autumn has well and truly arrived with its very temperamental weather pattern, already disrupted by climate change. We need to be prepared, but with just a very small winter wardrobe it means layers when needed to keep the draughts at bay</p>
<p>As I start this blog from 28th April, the sun shines, but nights are cold. Today I spent the morning painting with a friend, Marguerite. We have quite different painting styles but it’s a great companionship. Lots of chatting and cuppas too!</p>

<p>Our plans to go to the farm changed due to a family bereavement. Instead we would stay with the outlaws in Constantia, Cape Town.</p>
<p>This is about a 9h drive from Plettenberg. The journey was broken by an overnight stop at friends of Catherine and Dan, at Swellenberg, who cooked us a delicious meal and we were entertained by their lively year old son and dogs.</p>

<p>A few days of pottering around locally, including a mid week craft market ‘Old Nick’ s, where again lots of novel craft ideas and some excellent bronze sculptures were displayed. There I bought Eleanor’s first percussion instrument.. a ladybird rattle.</p>

<p>Also useful to ward off Tilia’s over enthusiastic, morning licks. Daniel exhibited his body beautiful to indulge in some open air reflexology after which we bought, which proved to be, an absolutely delicious butternut quiche for lunch.</p>

<p>A champagne lunch on the beautiful Hermanus coast celebrated Dan and Catherine’s 12th anniversary… Really that long?… and a satisfactory check at the natal clinic.

<p>Then a disappointment… There are buyers for our rental house, which means we have to find alternative accommodation yet again, just as we were feeling settled too. Another house a stone’s throw away suited our needs but unfortunately was a steep climb to the entrance. Apart from the wear and tear on our leg muscles, which we try to avoid at all costs, it would be difficult for Dan, even on his electric bike, and Catherine with pram to ascend.</p>

This commodity was gladly welcomed with hanging out tongues, sales of alcohol having been suspended for the last few weeks.</p>

<p>A lovely day and we had a delicious meal, lots of chatting and reliving of our previous times together. We are so happy to be welcomed as part of this all embracing family. All besotted with our new grand and great granddaughter. So many cuddles.. Eleanor must have wondered what this new world was like! We passed a lovely afternoon and were so pleased that they had made the long trip to be with us.</p>

We are now really loving this next rental… 5 moves in as many weeks!</p>
<p>A beautiful cottage house in the same street. .. We’re no.43…..Dan’s no. 57…so just a short walk. Fantastic mountain views with our own Vesusius, especially when the clouds ‘erupt’ on a misty morning.
<img src="images/c75ca83aa82b1e8acf270924e8f83a066854a31c.jpg" alt="">
It has 3 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms(1 en suite ). Large lounge and fitted kitchen. Garage and ample parking space.

Very spacious with an absolutely delightful garden.. Full of all the old English flowers and shrubs… Golden Rod, Buddleia, Wysteria plus indigenous Agapanthus and Bourgainvillea.
<img src="images/208753c09fe903cf5038d20758e4ab8816d9c00a.jpg" alt="">
All this is maintained by a local worker. It is an organised wilderness with lei water (water channeled from the mountains, that residents can subscribe to use in turn to fill their pools (dams)) running through it. There are 3 little bridges crossing it with bird tables and feeders around. A herb garden with a lemon tree in its midst completes the picture.
<img src="images/41a14a6bcb2fb5e3d518ea02b3f1b66f68dc3c10.jpg" alt="">
We now have it for 5 months assuming our visa applications are approved. It is an absolute paradise. We would love to buy..so may get hold of owner asking if he can stall selling until we are ready.</p>

<p>Mike’s back has now taken its toll of all the heavy lugging and lifting of cases. Home exercises rather than improving the situation only exasperated the condition. A local osteopath confirmed that he had damaged a muscle causing the pain which extended to the shoulder. Light exercise and much rest were prescribed. Unfortunately, the patient, doesn’t understand these two requirements, so recovery will take a long time. So now a ’grumpy ole man’</p>

<p>Cape Town is the second most populated city in South Africa after Johannesburg. It is colloquially called ‘the Mother City’.It houses the South African Parliament and is the administrative centre for all localities.</p>

<p>Saturday 2nd January, 6 am, saw Wendy negotiating the hour’s emergency drive to Hermanus Clinic with Catherine and Dan in the back trying to control her labour pains.

Basically a bedroom, shared bathroom and kitchen but with beautiful mountain views.</p>
<p>Janet, a loved local figure, was our very welcoming host. It was a bit worrying with the comings and goings of travelers, in view of virus, and we wanted to have our own place.</p>

<p>So after 2 weeks moved into the tiniest of cottages next to Greyton Nature Reserve and its mountains in Dan’s road until 16th.<br>
Then we will rent a lovely house in same road until we leave, hopefully extending our visas next week for 3 months. Our flight home has been cancelled.<br>
Who knows what next?</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s two weeks since our return from Port Alfred. During this time we have enjoyed an Indonesian supper cooked by Henriette next door and a braai with Mandy and Brian. Henriette prepared a salad accompanied by a very moreish hot peanut sauce and toasted coconut. The evening was spent listening to illustrated stories of her and Joop&rsquo;s amazing life. In contrast, we were then invited to Mandy and Brian&rsquo;s for a South African stew cooked in a cauldron over a braai. From the trees hung lanterns creating eerie shapes and shadows so with the cauldron and their three large dogs wandering about completed this awesome atmosphere. We were eight and we jelled in such good company with lots of chatter and a laugh or two!!!</p>

<p>A rainy start, after all the beautiful weather of recent weeks. Loaded to the gunnels we set off for our holiday in a clean, newly valeted car. We took the gravel back roads before joining the major route. Mistake! Moving aside to allow a large farm vehicle to pass, it rewarded us by revving through a deep puddle, consequently giving us a mud bath; windows and glass roof were smothered. An hour later the sun baked it to a hard crust&hellip;.. X-Trail pie!! On arrival at a planned rustic restaurant to meet friends, we found they had no electricity, so a very limited menu. Is this a bad omen? However, the lunch they managed to conjure up was delicious, and the friends very interesting company too. So many towns, all with their own rustic or historical charm. With no further incidence, three hours later, we installed ourselves in a small tent and a &lsquo;Rondavel’ in ‘Ebb and Flow’ campsite next to a meandering river, amidst a National Park, where we were to stay for 3 days.</p>

<p>These delightful children are from a small kindergarten just across the road from us. Out for a morning walk, with their cheerful carer, they were only too happy to oblige with this sunny photo, climbing over each other to make sure they were in the front! The last time I met them was on a walk in a very scarce fall of rain, all singing &ldquo;It&rsquo;s raining, it&rsquo;s pouring, the old man&rsquo;s snoring&rdquo; of course I just had to join in, much to their amusement!!!</p>

<p>Monday 11th found us on our way to Constantia, accepting Wendy and Joe&rsquo;s open invitation to stay any time, leaving Dan and Catherine to their own devices. So some fun time for the &lsquo;outlaws&rsquo;!! We arrived mid-afternoon, to a much cooler temperature. A hot cup of tea welcomed us. After a lovely fish supper with the family, the evening of nattering soon passed. A chilly night, we needed our long pants and sweaters.</p>

<p>Walking around Greyton most days, we are now seeing and absorbing the true essence of the town. &lsquo;Our&rsquo; cottage, &lsquo;Columba&rsquo;, is about 3/4 along Park Straat (Park Street) which runs the length of the town leading to a hikers&rsquo;paradise, Greyton Nature Reserve. The reserve lies on the steep southern slopes of the Riviersonderend (get your tongue around  that!) Mountains forming part of the Cape Folded Belt. It homes much wildlife including baboons which may occasionally wander into gardens in hope of some tasty morsel, so secure dustbin lids! Within, a choice of walks is displayed from which you can choose according to your ability, energy or challengability (a mo-ism). One of its several mountain pools serve as a swimming hole, to where locals walk from some distance to plunge into the mountain freshness.</p>

Not much has changed, except perhaps the market place, as mentioned in my last blog, and meeting some new acquaintances of Dan and Catherine. It&rsquo;s about a 1/2km walk to the market. People come from as far as Cape Town to shop here on a Saturday morning. All happy, smiley folk, so friendly and ready for a chat. The main street is crisscrossed with shoppers, horses clopping along, wagging tailed dogs waiting for a titbit, all of these being avoided by the traffic meandering through town.</p>

      <p>Greyton is a small village in the Western Cape, tucked against the mountains of Overberg. A town where everything is within walking distance using tree lined, dirt or tarred roads.</p>
<p><img src="images/p1040645-86290159.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The pace is slow, people friendly with horses free to roam, except on Saturday mornings when they give rides from the market, a horse and&rsquo; chariot&rsquo; act as a taxi. The heart of the village boasts restaurants, coffee cafes,charity shops , boutiques (bring and buy good quality clothes), and unusual gift shops. Thanks to the strict building code, the Cape vernacular architectural style has largely been preserved.</p>

Catherine spent  much of her happy childhood here, canoeing on the beautiful lagoon, collecting winkles and mussels among the rocks, netting for langoustines , prawns and other crustaceans from a fishing boat, with her siblings. Her grandparents bought the property, a five bedroomed holiday home many years ago, to accommodate the whole family on fun filled vacations. It has, and still is,  fulfilling its purpose . As the family has grown, Jenny, an aunt, has bought an adjacent property, so cousins with their partners, all water sport lovers can spend time here.

<p>No real excitement since I last put finger to keyboard. Thank you for your good wishes if you remembered my birthday, and if you didn&rsquo;t, thanks for not thinking of me getting older!!   The morning started with a 7 am walk into the mountains. Thought we&rsquo;d avoid the heat of the day and find the swimming dam. Didn&rsquo;t quite reach our destination as the path was getting too rough and stumbly, not wearing appropriate foot wear&hellip;. flip flops a bit precarious. Another excuse&hellip; a really minor one of course&hellip; was that we could hear the baboons in close proximity, and didn&rsquo;t have Catherine&rsquo;s bush skills to protect us ! Mike caught me daring them to come any nearer..</p>

<p>Life is very busy here. A lot to be achieved for Dan and Catherine to realize their dream. Two small rent-able straw bale units to be built, Catherine&rsquo;s practice to be launched, both giving the income to afford a larger straw bale home for themselves.  A car port is the first necessity to house the straw which is now on the site of the potential units. Being very difficult to get materials locally, meant a trip to Cape Town. Mike and I went alone as Catherine and Dan were busy. Also gave them a chance to reclaim their new, very comfortable bed, if only for a few days.</p>

      <p>Celebrating Catherine&rsquo;s birthday meant lunch out. Dan organized a surprise picnic for us all in the mountains, but due to inclement weather&hellip;. high winds and promised rain, chose a restaurant close by. It was like a French cafe , but with smiling, coloured staff. A lovely meal,three of us had yellow tail fish and Catherine had a lamb curry. We returned via the back roads mostly unmade and winding through townships. Some of these have become quite upmarket, having wooden or bamboo structures. It amazes me how many people fit into such a small home. They all seem so happy. Most have no transport, and walk for miles or hope for a lift. Catherine stayed in two of these &lsquo;huts&rsquo; whilst on a course so was our travel guide for the afternoon. There are mostly indigenous folk here who speak Africaans, but their smiles know no barriers.</p>

We decorated a fir branch with treasured hangings and some simple lights. A small wooden nativity scene which I bought at the local craft market completed the scene.

      <p>Since the arrival of the Kindle (and others) into our technological world, I must admit I&rsquo;ve been a bit of a purist snob when it comes to books. My reading material, whatever content,  must be enclosed in a cover, (albeit coffee cup strained) with dog eared pages to feel and thumb. Almost like a comfort blanket! My mind has changed!  What a fantastic invention. Over 100 pre selected books in one small package, always in my bag so I can choose at whim whatever I fancy, whenever I fancy&hellip;&hellip;.but &hellip;..can I clear the shelves at L&rsquo;Etang?</p>

      <p>We had arranged to move to local accommodation this week to give some space to the family and so as not to hinder Catherine&rsquo;s studies. On their kind insistence that we stay, we&rsquo;re still enjoying sharing the Van Dorsten&rsquo;s beautiful home. A delicious pizza supper welcomed us  back to Chorley. Wendy and Alison prepared a variety of toppings to mix and match, whilst Joe played chief chef of the pizza oven. Lots of wine to complement the different tastes. A tad different from our normal Monday egg&rsquo;n chips! <a href="https://www.artamo.click/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/wpid-P1010149_800x600.jpg"><img src="images/wpid-P1010149_800x600.jpg" alt="image" title="P1010149_800x600.JPG"></a></p>

Our room is so huge, wicker settee and chairs, fridge, bed, shower room and more than enough space for a ball room dance!!!! High A-frame, roof supporting beams and French doors with a beautiful sea view. Downstairs equally huge but divided into 2 twin bedrooms plus lounge and kitchen. We have just returned from a walk to village, but there isn&rsquo;t one, neither shops nor coffee stops. Fish are caught and sold from harbour daily, (looking forward to fish on the braai) but not today&hellip;. there is a &ldquo;meeting taking place&rdquo; &hellip;so looks like a swim day&hellip; beautiful covey beach flanked by dunes, then a notice &hellip;&hellip;..Wonder if I can fend them off with my noodles????</p>

<p>Three large jelly fish, washed ashore were already being attacked by miniscule whelks, a welcome, if short lived, tasty lunch. This was an amazing sight to watch. They clung to the stranded mound of living jelly, then through a proboscis type tube, sucked the juices, whilst in constant danger of being washed away. In the case of the small blue stingers they appeared to pull the poisonous sting out. Maybe their last supper !</p>

<p>Mike and I took a trip to Kalk Bay to change his Christmas pants  (trousers) and to wander round the boutiques and antique shops there. The density of holiday traffic meant we about turned and consequently found a huge market on the beach, plus a very fortunate parking space. Mainly blacks and coloureds, it was was a happy cacophony of voices, musicians, children with dancing from the locals. For them, lunch out was a chip and bean roll, or an overflowing sandwich, in one hand and a drink in the other&hellip; One lad had a live fish in the other, I wonder if he was eating from both hands!!!!  No purchases for us there,  but we came away lifted by the feel good ambience of it all. <a href="https://www.artamo.click/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/wpid-P10104961.jpg"><img src="images/wpid-P10104961.jpg" alt="image" title="P1010496.jpg"></a></p>

Another 2 years to become a herbal doctor. So the 4 of us went to an old fishing port, complete with decayed skeletal boats still tethered to the dock.

      <p>After 10 days of celebratory induced champagne toasts&hellip;. our arrival; grandparents dinner; Wendy and Joe s anniversary; David&rsquo;s birthday; and Alison&rsquo;s  graduation, we have journeyed 2hrs North to this beautiful lagoon where we will spend Christmas. The old but trusty family Landrover packed up to its gunnels.       So peaceful here with just Dan and Catherine at the moment.</p>
<p>Friday evening before we left was the Kirstenbosch Christmas carol concert. Loaded with picnic hampers and suitable beverages, 5 of us went to secure a good spot 3 hours before&rsquo; lift off &lsquo;.Dan and I had a buggy lift up the hill with all the consumables meeting Catherine and Mike at the top. The setting is in a botanical park, flanked by table mountain, complete with some truly original sculptures. Joe disappeared with his&rsquo; hip attachment&rsquo; a camera that can capture feeling as well as pictures. A brilliant photographer escaping his seemingly 18 hour day as a lawyer. We filled our time doing crosswords, listening to some excellent music and singing and sneaking an aperitif. The rest of family arrived and carols began. Amazing! Singing from the soul. Picnics finished, we all waved our glow sticks which also served to see the carol sheets , 17 in all. Whilst we were lusting (a mo&rsquo; ism) our lungs, a nativity concert was performing on stage. A remarkable evening. <a href="https://www.artamo.click/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/wpid-Carols.jpg"><img src="images/wpid-Carols.jpg" alt="image" title="Carols.jpg"></a></p>
